## Technology Used
* **Git:** Version control system to track changes to source code.

* **GitHub:** Hosts repository that can be deployed to GitHub Pages.

* **Node.js:** Used for package managment and to execute JavaScript code to build the command line tool for server-side scripting.

* **Express.js:** Express. js is a Node. js web application server framework, designed for building single-page, multi-page, and hybrid web applications. Used in this application to set middle ware for end point connection between the front end and backend.

* **Express.js Session:** is an Express.js middleware that uses sessions, a mechanism that helps applications to determine whether multiple requests came from the same client.

* **Handlebars.js:** is a logicless templating language that keeps the View and the code separate and compiles templates into JavaScript functions. It’s an extension to the Mustache templating language.

* **Sequelize:** Sequelize is an easy-to-use and promise-based Node.js ORM tool for Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, DB2, Microsoft SQL Server, and IBM i. It features solid transaction support, relations, eager and lazy loading, read replication and more.

* **Sequelize Connect Session:** provides applications with a scalable store for sessions. The express-session package’s default server-side session storage, MemoryStore, is purposely not designed for a production environment, will leak memory under most conditions, doesn’t scale past a single process, and is only meant for debugging and developing. The connect-session-sequelize package resolves these issues and is compatible with the Sequelize ORM.

* **MySQL2:** is a MySQL client for Node.js with a focus on performance. This npm package allows developers to connect Node.js applications to a MySQL database.

* **Dotenv:** Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a . env file into process. env . Storing configuration in the environment separate from code is based on The Twelve-Factor App methodology.

* **Bcrypt:** is a Node.js library that allows you to hash passwords. Hashing is the process of taking input and using a mathematical formula to chop and mix it up to produce an output of a specific length. Hashing is a one-way function, meaning that it can easily convert input to a fixed-size output, but it is difficult to invert, or convert in the opposite direction. This attribute allows developers to secure passwords when authenticating users for their applications.

* **Nodemon:** is a tool that helps develop node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.

* **JawsDB Add-On:** is a Heroku add-on that provides a fully functional MySQL database server for use with your Heroku application. For the our purposes, you’ll use the free Kitefin Shared pricing plan.
